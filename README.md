# Public API Requests
A fictitious employee directory that pulls 12 random users from the API at https://randomuser.me/ .

Clicking on a member will generate a modal pop-up that displays additional user details. You can cycle through the members using the modal's Prev & Next buttons.

The search bar allows you to filter and display members by letters in their first and last name.
